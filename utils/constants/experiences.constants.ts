        `I worked on a complex system that managed hockey match statistics and contained a vast amount of data. <br/>
        Given the importance of real-time data processing, I placed a strong focus on optimizing system performance and reducing response times.<br/>
        I made significant contributions to the API, which improved the efficiency of the site and the user experience. <br/>
        I also led the process of refactoring obsolete code, resulting in greater system stability and faster response times. Additionally, I identified and resolved numerous errors and bugs, which allowed for a smoother and uninterrupted experience for end-users.<br/> 
        I also collaborated closely with front-end developers to design and implement new features.<br/>
        In this project I worked with PHP, LARAVEL, MYSQL and DOCKER`,
